        <p>  I love you, my sons and daughters. You are Pure Water born by True Parents after the 6,000-year history
of Heaven's providence of salvation and indemnity for mankind. Our Creator, the Heavenly Parent, had a
dream and created the world of minerals, plants, and animals in His image, then finally created man and
woman who would become the first human ancestors. Adam and Eve from the Bible. After giving them
the period of growth, Our Creator waited for the day when they could perfect themselves. However,
Adam and Eve, who were supposed to become the first human ancestors, lost absolute faith, absolute
love, and absolute obedience due to the Fall resulting in mankind constantly unable to enjoy freedom due
to today's war and conflict. Heavenly Parent is the same from the beginning to the end. He is omniscient
and omnipotent. Therefore, while going down the arduous and difficult history of searching for True
Parents who can become the human ancestors and uphold the principles of creation that God established,
He selected the people of Israel and began the work of the providence of salvation. First, He began the
work to restore the lineage lost from the Fall and after 4,000 years, Jesus Christ, the only begotten son
whom He could call His son, was born.
     You need to be aware of this. All the 
twisted and wrong aspects of human history, the 
history of fallen humankind, will be untangled and 
reorganized one by one through the only begotten 
daughter, the mother of the universe and the mother 
of peace. And a world of one great family of 
humankind that attends Heavenly Parent will 
certainly be realized.
After Father’s ascension I sold Father’s helicopter. 
What was the first thing I did with the money? Did I 
not create the Wonmo Scholarship Foundation and 
use it toward your education? Have I not told you 
that you are pure water born through your parents, 
whom True Parents blessed? 
Pure water should not be still. Water must flow. It 
must flow out to the higher, wider world. If through 
you, the pure water, the fallen world is purified one 
nation at a time and the environment emerges 
wherein people come to know about True Parents 
and attend Heavenly Parent, what would that be? 
Isn’t that the kingdom of heaven on earth? 
Here, what matters most is that I believe in you, love 
you, and have raised you as very important treasures. 
The problem lies, however, in whether the 
environment where people can attend Heavenly 
Parent, the kingdom of heaven on earth, expands 
while True Parents are still on earth. True Mother is 
now over 80 years old. I have to live a long life, but 
how much longer will I be able to live? When I 
ascend to Heaven, I would like to be able to say with 
pride that you, the pure water, have become one with 
me and have expanded, to a certain number among 
the 8 billion people of the world, the environment in 
which people can attend Heavenly Parent.
    How great it would be if we could create an environment where the current 8 billion people could attend
our Heavenly Parent overnight. In order to do so, today, where we live in the era of one second using all
these machines of civilization, your wisdom and your efforts will become the central figure in creating a
realm of environment in which even one-third of the world's humanity can attend Heavenly Parent in a
short period of time. I hope it happens.</p>
